# Why IT?

**The Three Majors I Have Had**
+ Health Professions with a Doctorate in Physical Therapy
+ Business Administration with a Emphasis in Marketing
+ Information Technology with a minor in Psychology

When declaring a major at the university, I had no idea of what I wanted to do with my life but didn't want to go in undeclared. I had a slight interest in doing something in the Health Professions field after having to get physical therapy for my knee that past summer so i figured that would be something for me to pursue. I had a strong interst in the program as it would have challenged me and I would be making a difference in people's lives.

I quickly realized, I would have had to take anatomy classes and I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it since I get grossed out by those kind of things. I really got involved with [DECA](https://www.deca.org/) and had a love for business in high school espically marketing after I took Sports and Marketing Management taught by an amazing teacher. I was so excited to take business courses at a colliegate level after switching my major to business the week before Summer Welcome. I took *BA1500* during my first semester of my freshman year and quickly realized I wasn't the "business type."

I had always joked with my mom if business didn't work out then I would probably be an IT major. After knowing I wasn't wanting to be a business major anymore, I spoke with a different Advisor about what it owuld be like to be an IT major. After the meeting, I loved the idea of it and decided to take a chance. You know what they say, **"Third Times A Charm"** and I defintely hit the jackpot with this major. It challenges me and I love learning new things about this constantally changing topic.
