# What I would like to do with my IT degree

The main question I have been asked while I explain to people what I am majoring in is what am I going to do with my degree? I have explored deifferent job oppurtunities I can have with this major and I have always been interested in **Project and Team Management**

**Reasons Why I would love to go into this field:**
+ I still have a love for business so this would bring in aspects of that for leading a project and managing a team. 
+ My major will have a widespread of things I am knowledgeable about which will help land a job in specific sectors.
+ My minor in psychology will definetly help with the management aspect of this.

I can not wait to further my education and love for my major while I am at Mizzou!
