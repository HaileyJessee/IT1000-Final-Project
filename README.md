# Knowledge Obtained Through Coding

Going into IT, I thought I wouldn't be good at coding due to it being claimed one of the harder things to do in this field. I was pleasently proved wrong and love coding.

# My Future

I have learned so much about what I can do in IT thanks to my **IT1000** course and **IT1610** course. Though I am only through my first year of an IT Major, I have had ideas of what I would like my [Future](https://github.com/HaileyJessee/IT1000-Final-Project/blob/master/Future-Plan.md) to be like.
